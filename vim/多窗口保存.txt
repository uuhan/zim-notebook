							*ZZ*
ZZ			Write current file, if modified, and quit (same as
			":x").  (Note: If there are several windows for the
			current file, the file is written if it was modified
			and the window is closed).

							*ZQ*
ZQ			Quit without checking for changes (same as ":q!").
			{not in Vi}

MULTIPLE WINDOWS AND BUFFERS				*window-exit*

							*:qa* *:qall*
:qa[ll]		Exit Vim, unless there are some buffers which have been
		changed.  (Use ":bmod" to go to the next modified buffer).
		When 'autowriteall' is set all changed buffers will be
		written, like |:wqall|. {not in Vi}

:conf[irm] qa[ll]
		Exit Vim.  Bring up a prompt when some buffers have been
		changed.  See |:confirm|. {not in Vi}

:qa[ll]!	Exit Vim.  Any changes to buffers are lost. {not in Vi}
		Also see |:cquit|, it does the same but exits with a non-zero
		value.

							*:quita* *:quitall*
:quita[ll][!]	Same as ":qall". {not in Vi}

:wqa[ll] [++opt]				*:wqa* *:wqall* *:xa* *:xall*
:xa[ll]		Write all changed buffers and exit Vim.  If there are buffers
		without a file name, which are readonly or which cannot be
		written for another reason, Vim will not quit. {not in Vi}

:conf[irm] wqa[ll] [++opt]
:conf[irm] xa[ll]
		Write all changed buffers and exit Vim.  Bring up a prompt
		when some buffers are readonly or cannot be written for
		another reason.  See |:confirm|. {not in Vi}

:wqa[ll]! [++opt]
:xa[ll]!	Write all changed buffers, even the ones that are readonly,
		and exit Vim.  If there are buffers without a file name or
		which cannot be written for another reason, Vim will not quit.
		{not in Vi}
